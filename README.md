## User Story / Short Rundown
**As A** user who is forgetful :dizzy_face: <br/><br/>
**I Want** to remember where I left something :bulb: <br/><br/>
**So That** I don't forget where it's at :sunglasses: <br/><br/>

If you are anyting like us, then you can be extremely forgetful.

Sometimes you are in a rush to find something or you are just looking for an item you have misplaced.

This is where WhereAt comes into play.

Using our application, you will be able to keep track of any item that you store within our database.

## Tutorial (In Progress)
Simply start by launching the app.<br/>
**insert picture here**<br/><br/>

Then, enter the item that you wish to store along with it's location (pictures are optional).<br/>
**insert picture here**<br/><br/>

Afterwards, at anytime, you may come back to the application and enter what you wish to find.<br/>
**insert picture here**<br/><br/>

The app will then tell you exactly where you placed it!<br/>
**insert picture here**<br/><br/>
